# hello-world

Hello everyone,

My name is Mabel Tomety and I come from Ghana. I come from a family of 3 and I live with my dad. I love to hang outs with friends and family. I love music and singing is actually my talent. I'm a soprano singer and sing in my ward/stake choir. One interesting thing about me is how focused I am when I like something. I'm humble, respectful and outgoing. I love good compliments and surprises.
